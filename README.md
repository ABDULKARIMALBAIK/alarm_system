- If every sensor is OFF  =>  Green LED is ON
- If Fire sensor is ON    =>  Red led is ON
- If Smoke sensor is ON   =>  Yellow led is ON
- If Fire sensor is ON and Smoke sensor is ON and Water sensor is OFF  =>  Red and Yellow LEDs are ON  and  buzzer is ON
- If Fire sensor is ON and Smoke sensor is ON and Water sensor is ON   =>  Blue LED is ON  and  buzzer is ON
- If Android App has sent a message (order)  =>  Blue LED is ON  and  buzzer is ON
